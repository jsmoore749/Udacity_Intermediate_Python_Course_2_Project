    "Let's take a closer look at the purpose of each of these files and folders:\n",
    "\n",
    "    main.py: The main Python script that wraps the command-line tool, orchestrates the data pipeline by invoking the functions and classes that you'll write. You will not need to modify this file.\n",
    "    models.py: In this file, you'll define Python objects to represent a NearEarthObject and a CloseApproach. These objects will have a few attributes, a human-readable string representation, and perhaps a property or a method here or there.\n",
    "\n",
    "    extract.py: In this file, you'll write functions to read information from data files, creating NearEarthObjects and CloseApproaches from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    database.py: In this file, you'll define a NEODatabase class to encapsulate the entire data set (connecting NEOs and close approaches) and write methods to get NEOs by primary designation and by name, as well as to query the dataset with a collection of user-specified filters to generate an iterable stream of matching results.\n",
    "    filters.py: In this file, you'll create a plethora of filters to be used in conjunction with the NEODatabase to query for a stream of matching close approaches. You'll also write a utility function to limit the number of results produced from a stream.\n",
    "    write.py: Finally, in this file, you'll implement functions to write a stream of results (the CloseApproach objects generated by the NEODatabase) to a file either in JSON format or in CSV format.\n",
    "    helpers.py: A simple module that provides a few helpful utility functions to convert to and from DateTime objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data files are located in the data/ folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the starter code includes unit tests that will help you check your progress as you advance through this project. The unit tests all live in the tests/ folder. When the project is fully implemented, all of the unit tests should pass. To run all of the tests, you can use python3 -m unittest --verbose at the command line, although many tests will currently fail since the project isn't yet finished."
