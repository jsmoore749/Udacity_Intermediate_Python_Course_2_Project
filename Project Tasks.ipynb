You can use the .date() method on datetime objects to get the corresponding moment as a date.

    "\n",
    "Why yield? Recall that when we use yield in a Python function, it becomes a generator function, capable of pausing and resuming. Generators are often useful to represent sources of data streams. In our project, there might be thousands of close approaches matching the user's criteria, but we might only need to show the first ten (specified with the --limit command-line option). For these cases, we'll want the query function not to return a fully-computed collection of matching close approaches - which could take a while to compute - but rather to generate a stream of matching close approaches. In doing so, we'll make the query method almost instantaneous, and only do the work to determine the next element of the generator (the next matching CloseApproach) if another unit of code asks for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a plethora of other ways to optimize this method as well. For example, you could preprocess even more auxiliary data structures in the NEODatabase constructor to speed up specific queries. You might map dates to collections of close approaches that occurred on those dates, to speed up the --date criterion. You might order the close approaches by distance or velocity, or the NEOs by diameter, in order to more efficiently search for matches. Furthermore, you might be able to intelligently combine filters - for example, there are definitely no close approaches that are simulataneously closer than 0.1au (--max-distance 0.1) to Earth and further than 0.3au (--max-distance 0.3) from Earth. Depending on the exact approach you take, some of these changes may affect the design of your filters or the create_filter function, but there are many opportunities for performance improvements.\n",

By following the pseudocode given above, you can query the collection of close approaches to generate (with yield) a stream of results that match user-specified criteria.\n",
