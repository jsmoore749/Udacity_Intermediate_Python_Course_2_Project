    "At a high-level, you'll create Python code that implements a command-line tool to inspect and query a dataset of NEOs and their close approaches to Earth.\n",

    "Concretely, you'll have to read data from both a CSV file and a JSON file, convert that data into structured Python objects, perform filtering operations on the data, limit the size of the result set, and write the results to a file in a structured format, such as CSV or JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "When complete, you'll be able to inspect the properties of the near-Earth objects in the data set and query the data set of close approaches to Earth using any combination of the following filters:\n",
